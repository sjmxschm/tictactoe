# Tic Tac Toe

This repository contains simple C++ code for a tic tac toe game from the command line.

It allows single and dual player mode on a 4x4 grid.

To make it run, clone or copy this repository to your local drive. Then open a terminal and change directory to the folder where this tic tac toe code is located:

```console
>> cd " `yourDirectoryGoesHere` /tictactoe"
```
Once you are located within `tictactoe` you need to compile the C++ code with (make sure you have a C++ compiler installed before):

```console
>> g++ -o myTicTacToeGame main.cpp
```
This will build an (linked) executable file from the source code. To run the game, simply execute the program with
```console
>> myTicTacToeGame
```
This starts the program. It terminates by itself, but you can terminate it manually at every point with `Ctrl` + `C`.
